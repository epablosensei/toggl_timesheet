Toggl Timesheet
===============

I use Toggl (www.toggl.com) to track time for my consulting work and some clients need just a simple timesheet, so I adapted this small little project from [toggl_target](https://github.com/mos3abof/toggl_target) to fit my needs.

At work I need some simple timesheets for some clients, so I adapted this small little project from [toggl_target](https://github.com/mos3abof/toggl_target)
